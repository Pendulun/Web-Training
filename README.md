# Web-Training
These are just some random projects that I'm developing/developed following my studying on web development.
Right now, they are very simple and amateur projects because I'm still learning things. I hope someday to make interesting ones.

<h1>Projects</h1>

  <dt><h1><a href="./SteamProject/pagina.html"> Steam Project</a></h1> </dt>

      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>This is sort of a home page of my steam account with games that I own sorted by categories.
    In addition, there's some information about my account with my best friends.</p>
      <p>The main objective of this one was to train on the layout division and to understand color schemes/palletes. I do have some notion on text-fonts but I didn't want to change or add any font with external ones. Maybe sometime I'll do it.</p>
      <h2> Thougths</h2>
    <p> When I worked in this project, I had studied about HTML and some CSS but nothing of JavaScript, thats why it doesn't have any more functionality then links to my own and my friends steam accounts.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt><h1><a href="./SpetacularTeam/index.html">Spetacular Team</a></h1></dt>
    <br>
    <dd>
       <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p> This project's goal is to make a fictional team homepage. The team is called Spetacular Esporte Clube created by me. The team's logo was also created by me using Inkscape.</p>
      <h2>Thougths</h2>
        <p> This time, I tried to use what I've learned so far in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4, still no JavaScript.</p>
        <p> It was great fun to create the 4 football team's logos in Inkscape. Still have to improve my understanding in color choosing and combinations.</p>
         <p>I think that I learned alot about the bootstrap grid system and tried to make it responsive at a begginers level. Also, I was surprised that my main difficulty was to get the footer in the right place. </p>
        <p> I'm not going to finish all the other pages aimed to the rest of the menu bar because it would get somewhat repetitive and I've already done what I meant to do. </p>
