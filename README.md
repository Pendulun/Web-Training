# Web-Training
These are just some random projects that I'm developing/developed following my studying on web development.
Right now, they are very simple and amateur projects because I'm still learning things. I hope someday to make interesting ones.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<dl>
<dt> Steam Project </dt>
<dd> <p>This is sort of a home page of my steam account with games that I own sorted by categories.
In addition, there's some information about my account with my best friends.</p>
<p> When I worked in this project, I had studied about HTML and some CSS but nothing of JavaScript, thats why it doesn't have any more 
functionality then links to my own and my friends steam accounts.</p>
<p>The main objective of this one was to train on the layout division and to understand color schemes/palletes. I do have some notion on
text-fonts but I didn't want to change or add any font with external ones. Maybe sometime I'll do it.</p>
