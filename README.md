# Web-Training
These are just some random projects that I'm developing/developed following my studying on web development.
Right now, they are very simple and amateur projects because I'm still learning things. I hope someday to make interesting ones.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<dl>
  <dt> Steam Project </dt>
    <br>
    <dd> <p>This is sort of a home page of my steam account with games that I own sorted by categories.
    In addition, there's some information about my account with my best friends.</p>
    <p> When I worked in this project, I had studied about HTML and some CSS but nothing of JavaScript, thats why it doesn't have any more 
    functionality then links to my own and my friends steam accounts.</p>
    <p>The main objective of this one was to train on the layout division and to understand color schemes/palletes. I do have some notion on text-fonts but I didn't want to change or add any font with external ones. Maybe sometime I'll do it.</p>

   <dt> Spetacular Team </dt>
    <br>
    <dd> <p> This project's goal is to make a fictional team homepage. The team is called Spetacular Esporte Clube created by me. The team's logo was also created by me using Inkscape.</p>
        <p> This time, I tried to use what I've learned so far in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4, still no JavaScript.</p>
        <p> It was great fun to create the 4 football team's logos in Inkscape. I think that I learned alot about the bootstrap grid system in this and was surprised of that the my main difficulty was to get the footer to the rigth place haha.</p>
        <p> I'm not going to finish all the other pages aimed to the rest of the menu bar because it would get somewhat repetetive and I've already done what I meant to do. </p>
